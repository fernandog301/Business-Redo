Business Redo Build
Using the Figma that we created, we built a fully functional website with responsiveness for desktop and mobile.


Peer Review by Zach Dressel, 1/6/24:

* Video on the landing page is much larger on the vercel host vs the figma
 - Video is set to max width and height which is making it take up the maximum space (1440px) and keeping its height to maintain aspect ratio.
	- can be fixed by setting the box the video is in to have a smaller height and then setting the video to be fixed on the center inside that box (will cut off parts of video, like figma)
	- video has controls enabled instead of auto-play like the figma

* spacing for the row with the car photo and text columns is odd at larger screen resolution, but is responsive in both.
	- spacing can be fixed by setting a max-width on the row that contains the elements.

* about page has some mis-formatting on the Meet the Owners section (banner text is on top of the image box and text box)
* about page images aren't centered properly and don't have proper css positioning to be responsive on larger screens.

*No issues on Our Trucks page.
*No issues on Vendor application page.

* clicking on the Stocklandia Logo to the left to get to the landing page isn't as intuitive as having a home page link with the other page links, and having both would work great.

Overall review of the website is that it is clean looking save for some easy to fix issues. Very well done.
